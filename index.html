        Who was she?
      </h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Virginia Woolf was an English writer, considered one of the most
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; important modernist 20th-century authors and a pioneer in the use of
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; stream of consciousness as a narrative device.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; She was home-schooled in English classics and Victorian literature from
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; a young age. From 1897 to 1901, she attended the Ladies' Department of
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; King's College London, where she studied classics and history and came
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; into contact with early reformers of women's higher education and the
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp; women's rights movement.
