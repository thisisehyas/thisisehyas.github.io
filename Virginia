        Who was she?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Virginia Woolf was an English writer, considered one of the most
        <br />
        <br />
        important modernist 20th-century authors and a pioneer in the use of
        <br />
        <br />
        stream of consciousness as a narrative device.
        <br />
        <br />
        She was home-schooled in English classics and Victorian literature from
        <br />
        <br />
        a young age. From 1897 to 1901, she attended the Ladies' Department of
        <br />
        <br />
        King's College London, where she studied classics and history and came
        <br />
        <br />
        into contact with early reformers of women's higher education and the
        <br />
        <br />
        women's rights movement.
